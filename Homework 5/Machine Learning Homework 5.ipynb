    "\n",
    "Keras includes the CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images. Each contains 1 of 10 different objects, and the dataset is often used as a benchmark for classification schemes. The 10 different classes are: airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. In this assignment you will build a CNN to attempt to correctly classify these images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the labels on the data to see how many of each class are present in the training and test datasets. Do you foresee any issues with this data balance? Plot a few of the images as well to get a sense for what the images look like to the human eye. You may need to reverse the normalization in the template by dividing by 255.\n",
